            "3. Plan your implementation to match the existing approach\n"

            "5. Test your changes to ensure correctness\n"
            "6. Clean up: remove unused imports, dead code, temporary files, and commented-out code\n\n"

            "- Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary abstractions\n"
            "- Match existing patterns, naming conventions, and architectural decisions\n"
            "- Follow existing code style: indentation, formatting, import organization\n"
            "- Maintain type safety - avoid 'any' types or unsafe casts\n"
            "- Write self-documenting code with comments only where needed\n"
            "- Focus strictly on requirements - no speculative features\n"
            "- Leave no unused code, imports, or files behind\n"
            "- NEVER modify untracked files or gitignored files (.env, credentials, etc.)\n"
            "- Only work with tracked source code files\n\n"
            "**FUNCTION SIGNATURES:**\n"
            "- Don't make functions flexible unless flexibility is actually needed\n"
            "- If a function is only called one way, use concrete types and parameters for that use case\n"

            "  * The function is already called in multiple ways in the existing code\n"
            "  * The requirements explicitly call for configurable behavior\n"
            "  * There's a clear, immediate need for flexibility\n"
            "- Avoid anticipating future needs - solve the current problem directly\n"
            "- Keep function signatures as simple and specific as possible\n\n"
            "**EFFICIENCY:**\n"
            "- Work incrementally - don't try to do everything at once\n"
            "- Use targeted file reads instead of reading entire large files\n"
            "- Avoid infinite loops or excessive recursion\n"
            "- If stuck, move on and note what needs manual attention\n\n"

            "1. Stage all changes: git add -A\n"
            "2. Create a commit with a CONCISE commit message:\n"
            "   - Keep it simple and descriptive\n"
            "   - Use lowercase\n"
            "   - Under 80 characters if possible\n"
